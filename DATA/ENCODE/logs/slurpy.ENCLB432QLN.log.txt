INFO: Found properly paired reads.
INFO: Running analysis on paired-end fastqs:

------  Read Filtering and Splitting  ------

INFO: 0 split pair-end fastqs and log - ./debug/ENCLB432QLN_0.fastp.splits.ENCLB432QLN.txt - detected.
	Skipping call to fastp.
	If this seems incorrect remove the ./splits directory and start again.
WARNING: 1 sets of paried reads were detected but no calls to fastp were submitted to the shell.
	If this was expected, ignore this message.
	Otherwise remove the ./splits directory and try again.
INFO: The number of paired-end reads within pair 1 is: 84117916

---------  Alignment with BWA-mem  ---------

WARNING: No paired fastq files were detected.
WARNING: No paired fastq files were detected.
WARNING: 1 sets of paried reads were detected but no calls to bwa-mem were submitted to the shell.
	If this was expected, ignore this message.
	Otherwise remove the ./splits directory and log files of the splits and try again.
